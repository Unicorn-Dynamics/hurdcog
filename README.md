# GNU Hurd Cognitive Architecture

**Project:** GNU Hurd Cognitive Microkernel Operating System  
**Version:** 2.0 - Clean Architecture Focus  
**Status:** Reorganization Phase

## Overview

This repository represents the world's first cognitive microkernel operating system, integrating GNU Hurd's modular architecture with advanced cognitive computing frameworks. The project aims to solve 350+ open GNU Hurd issues through intelligent, self-optimizing system components.

## Core Vision

Transform GNU Hurd from a traditional microkernel OS into a cognitive operating system that can:
- **Self-diagnose** and **self-heal** system issues
- **Optimize performance** through machine learning
- **Adapt** to changing workloads and hardware
- **Learn** from system behavior patterns
- **Coordinate** distributed resources intelligently

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GCC configured for i686-gnu target
- GNU Make and Autotools
- Git for development

### Building
```bash
# Configure the build
./configure --host=i686-gnu

# Build the complete system
make

# Build and test Kokkos integration (Phase 2)
make kokkos-demo
make kokkos-test

# Install (requires proper Hurd environment)
make install
```

### Testing Kokkos Integration
```bash
# Run interactive demonstration
cd performance/kokkos-integration
./kokkos-hurd-demo --demo

# Run complete test suite
./kokkos-hurd-demo --test
```
