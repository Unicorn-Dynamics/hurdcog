1. **AtomSpace Integration**: All cognitive operations are represented and tracked in the distributed atomspace
2. **Agent System Compatibility**: Compatible with existing SKZ agent patterns and roles
3. **Attention-based Prioritization**: Uses ECAN attention allocation for resource management
4. **Tensor-based Computation**: Supports tensor operations for cognitive processing

## Configuration Options

The interface supports various configuration options:

- **Parallel Processing**: `'kokkos` for high-performance parallel computation
- **JIT Compilation**: `'compiler-explorer` for dynamic code optimization
- **Distributed Storage**: `'atomspace` for distributed memory management
- **Learning Modes**: Pattern recognition, temporal difference, reinforcement learning
