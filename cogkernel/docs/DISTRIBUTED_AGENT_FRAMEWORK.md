## API Reference

### Framework Management

```scheme
;; Create framework
(make-distributed-agent-framework #:deployment-strategy 'DISTRIBUTED)

;; Start/stop framework
(framework-start! framework)
(framework-stop! framework)

;; Get framework state and metrics
(framework-get-metrics framework)
```

### Agent Deployment

```scheme
;; Deploy agent
(framework-deploy-agent! framework agent-spec)

;; Terminate agent  
(framework-terminate-agent! framework agent-id)

;; Get agent status
(framework-get-agent-status framework agent-id)

;; List active agents
(framework-list-active-agents framework)
```

### Scaling Operations

```scheme
;; Scale agents to target count
(framework-scale-agents! framework agent-type target-count)
```

```scheme
;; Perform health check
(framework-health-check framework)

(framework-get-metrics framework)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Framework Setup

```scheme
;; Create and start framework
(define framework (make-distributed-agent-framework 
                    #:deployment-strategy 'DISTRIBUTED))
(framework-start! framework)

;; Deploy some agents
(framework-deploy-agent! framework '(build-coordinator BUILD))
(framework-deploy-agent! framework '(system-monitor MONITOR))
(framework-deploy-agent! framework '(repair-agent REPAIR))

```

### Health Monitoring Example

```scheme
;; Perform comprehensive health check
(let ((health-report (framework-health-check framework)))
  (format #t "Overall health: ~a~%" 
          (assoc-ref health-report 'overall-health))
  (format #t "Healthy agents: ~a/~a~%" 
          (assoc-ref health-report 'healthy-agents)
          (assoc-ref health-report 'total-agents)))
```
